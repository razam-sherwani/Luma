# ✅ Render Deployment ALLOWED_HOSTS Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

**Error**: `DisallowedHost at / - Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'luma-444u.onrender.com'`

**Root Cause**: Your Render app domain `luma-444u.onrender.com` was not included in Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.

**Solution Applied**: Added your Render domain to the default ALLOWED_HOSTS list.

## 🔧 **Fix Details**

**Before**:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='127.0.0.1,localhost', ...)
```

**After**:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='127.0.0.1,localhost,luma-444u.onrender.com,*.onrender.com', ...)
```
