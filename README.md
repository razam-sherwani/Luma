# Pulse - The Intelligent Engagement Platform

Pulse is an intelligent dashboard that acts as a co-pilot for healthcare engagement managers. By simulating insights from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and tracking the latest medical research, the platform generates prioritized, actionable alerts to help healthcare reps know exactly who to contact, what to talk about, and why it's critically relevant today.

## Features

- **Smart Dashboard**: View overdue engagements, new research alerts, and EMR flags in one place
- **HCP Profile Management**: Detailed healthcare provider profiles with engagement history
- **Research Tracking**: Stay updated with the latest medical research by specialty
- **EMR Insights**: Monitor patient volume changes and key metrics
- **Engagement Logging**: Easy-to-use forms for tracking interactions with HCPs

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 5.0
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/razam-sherwani/Pulse.git
   cd Pulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (optional: use virtual environment)
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install Django (if not already installed)
   pip install django
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies for Tailwind CSS**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js packages
   npm install
   
   # Build Tailwind CSS
   npm run build-css
   
   # For development with auto-rebuild:
   npm run watch-css
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Create and apply migrations
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Load realistic EMR data into the database** (RECOMMENDED)
   ```bash
   # First install required packages for data processing
   pip install pandas requests faker
   
   # Download real healthcare data from CMS and generate realistic EMR dataset
   python download_emr_data.py
   
   # Populate your database with real EMR data
   python seed_real_emr.py
   ```
   
   This will create realistic data based on **real CMS provider data**:
   - 50 Healthcare Providers from real CMS database with authentic specialties
   - 15 Patient Cohorts with real medical conditions (ICD-10 codes)
   - 228 EMR Records with realistic patient volumes and outcomes
   - 40 Treatment Outcomes with evidence-based success rates
   - 10 Research Updates based on current medical literature
   - 98 HCP-Cohort relationships based on specialty alignment
   - 50 Actionable Insights for clinical decision support
   
   **OR load basic sample data** (alternative):
   ```bash
   # Run the basic seed script for simple test data
   python seed.py
   ```

5. **Create a superuser** (optional, for admin access)
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
   - Sign up for a new account or log in
   - Explore the dashboard with the pre-loaded sample data
